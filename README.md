# Product-Defects-Poisson-Distribution-Simulation
This project explores the Poisson(Î» = 7) distribution to simulate and analyze the number of defective products produced daily in a factory. We use Python libraries such as scipy.stats and numpy to calculate theoretical probabilities and analyze simulated real-world data.
